# Water-Quality-Predictor-A-Machine-Learning-Driven-Solution-for-Safe-Drinking-Water
This project focuses on predicting water quality for consumption, addressing the critical need for safe freshwater, which constitutes only 3% of Earth's water. It aims to ensure access to sanitary water for human and ecosystem well-being.
This is a part of oneAPI hackathon 2023.

# Water Quality Predictor

## Proposed Solution
We propose the development of a Water Quality Predictor utilizing the **oneAPI daal4py** library and **sklearnx Patches**, which are used for optimization of Machine Learning algorithms. By harnessing the capabilities of **IntelÂ® oneAPI**, we will construct a **Random Forest Classifier Model**. This approach will significantly enhance the accuracy of water safety predictions.

## Impact
The impact of this solution on human lives and environments is substantial. Accurately assessing water quality empowers individuals to make informed decisions about water consumption, leading to improved public health and environmental conservation efforts.

## Target Audience
The target audience for this project includes:
- Individuals seeking to assess the safety of their drinking water at home.
- Communities and local authorities responsible for managing public water supplies.
- Environmental agencies focused on water quality monitoring and protection.
